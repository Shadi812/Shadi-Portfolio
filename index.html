			<h3>About Shadi</h3>
			<p>During my time in collage I studied Finance with a minor in economics.</p>

			<p> I am interested in Web Development because it challanges me. This  allows me to be creative in my approach on how to resolve issues and find a solution to a problem whether it is on my own or with a team. Working with others to come to a solution is important because in a team setting we would be able to bounce ideas off eachother, and see things from a different perspective, that I may have not thought of if I have worked alone. </p>

			<p>Some Things I Enjoy:</p>
			<ul> <!-- created an unorded list of things i enjoy-->
				<li>Going to the Gym.</li>
				<li>Learning new skills.</li>
				<li>Traveling, especially somewhere warm!</li>
				</ul>
